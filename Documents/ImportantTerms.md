# Overview
Their are lots of important terms used that are neccessary to understand. Here is the detailed description of all those terms.

## EDA
EDA stands for **Exploratory Data Analysis**.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in the data analysis process, where you use statistical graphics, plots, and other techniques to understand the structure and patterns in the dataset. 
The primary goal of EDA is to summarize the main characteristics of the data, often with visual methods, before applying any machine learning models or statistical tests. 
It helps in identifying trends, patterns, anomalies, and potential relationships between variables.

### Dimension
The columns that do not have numeric values are called Dimensions.
For e.g 'first_name' is a dimension while 'cost' is not.

### Measures 
The columns that have numeric data are called measures.
For e.g 'cost' is a measure

### Dimension/Measure Check
The question here arises, how to check whether a column is a dimension or a measure. We can do this by asking two simple questions
**1. Is the column numeric**
**2. Does it makes sense to aggregate it**

### **Concept**
